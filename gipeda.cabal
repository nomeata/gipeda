synopsis:            Git Performance Dashboard
description:
 Gitpeda is a a tool that presents data from your program's benchmark suite
 (or any other source), with nice tables and shiny graphs.
 .
 So it is up to you whether you have a polling shell script loop, a post-commit
 hook or a elaborate jenkins setup. As long as the performance data ends up in
 the `logs/` directory, gipeda is happy.
 .
 Gipeda produces static pages. In fact, the (single) html file and the
 accompagning JavaScript code is completely static. Giepda just generates a
 large number of json files. This has the advantage of easy deployment: Just put
 gipeda in your webspace of copy the files to some static web hosting and you
 are done. This putts very little load on your server, is cache friendly and has
 no security problems.
 .
